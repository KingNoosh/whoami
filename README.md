## Hey, I'm Anosh and it looks like you're about to work with me, here's what you probably want to know

### Motivation for this document:
This is my Manager README, a document that helps introduce you to my management style, philosophy, and expectations. The intended audience is primarily anyone who reports in to me, though anyone is free to read it - or even provide feedback on it! Please treat it as a reference and promise on how I will conduct myself as a manager, and what I expect from you.

I urge you to hold me accountable to my promises, and to call out anything that might be missing from this document. Without your guidance, I will not be able to improve as a manager.

### What you can expect of me as your manager:
A weekly 1:1 (unless you specifically prefer a different cadence) where we’ll work on challenges, goals, and priorities to support you and play to your strengths. As part of this, I’ll do my best to hold a safe space for you and to know you as a person, and connect together as humans to whatever degree feels best for you. I will also share wider context and my own areas of focus or challenge. For managers, you can also expect regular “skip level” 1:1s where I’ll chat with your direct reports.

Clear, gentle, honest communication. I promise not to leave you guessing what I "really" think or expect you to read between the lines of what I’m saying. If it’s not clear, and you have a nagging feeling, let me know so I can fix it! It’s not intentional. I’ll also reply promptly to you, or let you know when you can expect a reply, if you reach out.

### One-on-ones:
These meetings are designed to give you a dedicated time and place to ask anything and everything.

Hopefully we talk about [things you wouldn’t otherwise bring up](https://medium.com/@mrabkin/the-art-of-the-awkward-1-1-f4e1dcbd1c5c) in a group setting. I want our 1:1 to be a safe place; if this isn’t the case please tell my boss.
We will go through your agenda first and if time permits I will always have some questions. First and foremost these meetings are for you.
Urgent matters should not wait for a 1:1.

### Career Development:
  - Your career is yours.
  - I will coach, I will offer feedback.
  - I will provide you with outside perspective. You may know where you want to be, but when you’re living it in the moment it can be hard to see if there’s a gap and where.
  - I will partner with you to line up the opportunities needed for the growth you are targeting.
  - But at the end of the day, it’s your career. You set your goals. You set your priorities. You determine whether you make the time to get there.

### Conditions I like to work in:

- As long as I'm able to charge my laptop and connect to the internet, I'm flexible. I have no preference yet.
- Operating temperature: between 17℃ to 22℃

### The times/hours I like to work:

- Start and end during daylight preferably, this is mostly because I'd like to still be able to enjoy the journey home and feel as if there's more to do.

### The best ways to communicate with me:

- No headphones; Feel free to grab my attention. I don't mind helping others since if I don't have my headphones on, it means I'm just pacing out my tasks.
- Headphones on; Message me on Slack. With my headphones on I'm usually in the zone and trying to get something accomplished so I'd appreciate as little distraction as possible.

### The ways I like to receive feedback:

- Face to face, I prefer human interaction much more than over Slack/Zoom as it feels much more "real" and helps me focus on what you're saying.
- Over email with a lot of explicit detail, this helps me greatly as you should mention what I need to improve on and hopefully how too. A written record helps me keep reminders as to what to do and how.

### Things I love:

- Summer print shirts
- Bubble tea
- Privacy advocacy

### Things I struggle with:

- I get into rabbit holes; When I'm almost on the verge of completing something or trying to solve a problem in an overcomplicated way, I'll end up sometimes trapping myself in a loop and may take longer than usual to realise I'm in a loop.
- Short attention span, I will sometimes lose context of conversations happening right in front of me, don't fret, just ensure the point has been made and communicated to me. I will be happy to reiterate any of the points just in case.
- Forgetful so I write tasks down, this is linked to the above but I will switch context sometimes and 95% chance forget everything just mentioned unless I've written it down or somehow deemed it super duper critical.

### Other things to know about me:

- I hum and tap my desk a lot, if this gets annoying, feel free to tap my shoulder and tell me and I will stop.

### Favourite saying:

*“The greatest barrier to success is the fear of failure.”* - Sven Goran Eriksson
