### Conditions I like to work in:

- As long as I'm able to charge my laptop and connect to the internet, I'm flexible. I have no preference yet.
- Operating temperature: between 17℃ to 22℃

### The times/hours I like to work:

- Start and end during daylight preferably, this is mostly because I'd like to still be able to enjoy the journey home and feel as if there's more to do.

### The best ways to communicate with me:

- No headphones; Feel free to grab my attention. I don't mind helping others since if I don't have my headphones on, it means I'm just pacing out my tasks.
- Headphones on; Message me on Slack. With my headphones on I'm usually in the zone and trying to get something accomplished so I'd appreciate as little distraction as possible.

### The ways I like to receive feedback:

- Face to face, I prefer human interaction much more than over Slack/Zoom as it feels much more "real" and helps me focus on what you're saying.
- Over email with a lot of explicit detail, this helps me greatly as you should mention what I need to improve on and hopefully how too. A written record helps me keep reminders as to what to do and how.

### Things I love:

- Summer print shirts
- Bubble tea
- Privacy advocacy

### Things I struggle with:

- I get into rabbit holes; When I'm almost on the verge of completing something or trying to solve a problem in an overcomplicated way, I'll end up sometimes trapping myself in a loop and may take longer than usual to realise I'm in a loop.
- Short attention span, I will sometimes lose context of conversations happening right in front of me, don't fret, just ensure the point has been made and communicated to me. I will be happy to reiterate any of the points just in case.
- Forgetful so I write tasks down, this is linked to the above but I will switch context sometimes and 95% chance forget everything just mentioned unless I've written it down or somehow deemed it super duper critical.

### Other things to know about me:

- I hum and tap my desk a lot, if this gets annoying, feel free to tap my shoulder and tell me and I will stop.

### Favourite saying:

*“The greatest barrier to success is the fear of failure.”* - Sven Goran Eriksson
